Changes in version 1.0.3:
+ FC and log2-FC calculation added (via 'log2_FC' function);
+ 'top_results' function edited to sort results by p-value and log2-FC.

Changes in version 1.0.1:
+ substantial speed-up in `distinct_test` (~7 times faster);
+ parallel computing introduced;
+ modelling of covariates introduced, via a design matrix;
+ two new functions to visualize results: `plot_cdfs` and `plot_densities`.
