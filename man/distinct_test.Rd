}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{linkS4class{SummarizedExperiment}} or a \code{linkS4class{SingleCellExperiment}} object.}

\item{name_assays_expression}{a character ("logcounts" by default), 
indicating the name of the assays(x) element which stores the expression data (i.e., assays(x)$name_assays_expression).
We strongly encourage using normalized data, such as counts per million (CPM) or log2-CPM (e.g., 'logcounts' as created via \code{scater::logNormCounts}).
In case additional covariates are provided (e.g., batch effects), we highly recommend using log-normalized data, such as log2-CPM (e.g., 'logcounts' as created via \code{scater::logNormCounts}).}

\item{name_cluster}{a character ("cluster_id" by default), 
indicating the name of the colData(x) element which stores the cluster id of each cell (i.e., colData(x)$name_cluster).}

\item{name_sample}{a character ("sample_id" by default), 
indicating the name of the colData(x) element which stores the sample id of each cell (i.e., colData(x)$name_sample).}

\item{design}{a \code{\linkS4class{matrix}} or \code{\linkS4class{data.frame}} with the design matrix of the study (e.g., built via model.matrix(~batches), 
design must contain one row per sample, while columns include intercept, group and eventual covariates such as batches.
Row names of design must indicate the sample ids, and correspond to the names in colData(x)$name_sample.}

\item{column_to_test}{indicates the column(s) of the design one wants to test (do not include the intercept).}

\item{P}{the number of permutations to use on all gene-cluster combinations.}

\item{P_2}{the number of permutations to use, when a (raw) p-value is < 0.1 (500 by default).}

\item{P_3}{the number of permutations to use, when a (raw) p-value is < 0.01 (2,000 by default).}

\item{P_4}{the number of permutations to use, when a (raw) p-value is < 0.001 (10,000 by default).
In order to obtain a finer ranking for the most significant genes,
if computational resources are available, we encourage users to set P_4 = 20,000.}

\item{N_breaks}{the number of breaks at which to evaluate the comulative density function.}

\item{min_non_zero_cells}{the minimum number of non-zero cells (across all samples) in each cluster for a gene to be evaluated.}

\item{n_cores}{the number of cores to parallelize the tasks on (parallelization is at the cluster level: each cluster is parallelized on a thread).}
}
\value{
A \code{\linkS4class{data.frame}} object.
Columns `gene` and `cluster_id` contain the gene and cell-cluster name, while `p_val`, `p_adj.loc` and `p_adj.glb` report the raw p-values, locally and globally adjusted p-values, via Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) correction.
In locally adjusted p-values (`p_adj.loc`) BH correction is applied in each cluster separately, while in globally adjusted p-values (`p_adj.glb`) BH correction is performed to the results from all clusters.

# load the input data:
data("Kang_subset", package = "distinct")
Kang_subset

# create the design of the study:
samples = Kang_subset@metadata$experiment_info$sample_id
group = Kang_subset@metadata$experiment_info$stim
design = model.matrix(~group)
# rownames of the design must indicate sample ids:
rownames(design) = samples
design

# Note that the sample names in `colData(x)$name_sample` have to be the same ones as those in `rownames(design)`.

# In order to obtain a finer ranking for the most significant genes, if computational resources are available, we encourage users to increase P_4 (i.e., the number of permutations when a raw p-value is < 0.001) and set P_4 = 20,000 (by default P_4 = 10,000).
